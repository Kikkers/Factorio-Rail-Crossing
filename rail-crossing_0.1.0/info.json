  "description": "Adds a special rail segment that imitates a bridge or tunnel, allowing trains to ignore other trains on this segment. 
  Warning 1: This mod exploits a bug, and the mod may stop working in the future.
  Warning 2: Train carriages are modified to work with the crossing, making them collision-free. This makes it problematic to place trains. It's advised to have only 1 of a type of train carriage in your inventory at once while placing them.",
