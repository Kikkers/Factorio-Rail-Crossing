Factorio: Rail-Crossing
=========================

Mod for factorio that adds the ability to cross rail networks. Most important notes: 
+ New rail segment that allows two trains to pass at the same time. Imagine this is a bridge or tunnel.
+ Trains don't kill anymore (byproduct of getting the rail segment working), and you can walk through them.
+ Trains should be constructed CAREFULLY, with maximum 1 train item in your inventory at once.

Install instructions:
No special requirements here, just copy the "Smart-Circuit_Systems_..." folder into the mods folder. The mods folder is created after running Factorio once. After copying, restart Factorio and open mods in the main menu, you should see the mod already enabled there.

Known issues:
+ Placing trains may glitch out and crash the game if you're placing them with a stack of more than 1 items. This seems a necessary compromise to make the bug functional. 
+ Placing trains may not work sometimes because of a safeguard related to the above issue. Try building the train farther from other trains.
